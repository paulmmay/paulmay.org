<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>Paul helps companies pull the future forward; identifying and acting upon opportunities that sit beyond near-term product roadmaps. He does this by helping companies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Re-connect with customers’ jobs to be done</li>
  <li>Understand relevant market forces and competitive benchmarks</li>
  <li>Explore new technologies via prototyping</li>
  <li>Separate true opportunities from mere ideas</li>
  <li>Establish and communicate an ambitious product vision</li>
  <li>Build and operate high-performing, cross-disciplinary product teams</li>
  <li>Implement a design-led approach to product development</li>
  <li>Ship useful, delightful, branded digital products</li>
</ul>

<p>This design-led approach lets companies break out of short-term thinking. It delivers more value to customers in shorter timeframes, and sets a new benchmark for quality in product categories.</p>
