        <p>Hello, my name is Paul May. I’m VP of Design at the software supply chain company <a href="https://cloudsmith.com">Cloudsmith</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I’ve worked with <a href="https://frogdesign.com">Frog Design</a> and <a href="https://monokoto.com">Monokoto</a> for clients including Apple, Beats, Coloplast, Comcast, Denon, Ferrosan Medical Devices, Fritz Hansen, Marantz, Nordic Capical, GN Hearing, the UK Government, Virgin Atlantic.</p>

<p>I spent a little while at the <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk">Royal College of Art</a> in London, helping students with interaction design and electronics projects. I learned as much from them as they did from me.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.mskcc.org">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> I worked on their implementation of IBM Watson, and co-founded a cross-disciplinary data science + product development team,</p>

<p>I studied at <a href="https://www.dcu.ie">DCU</a> in Dublin, and attended NYU as a Fulbright Scholar.</p>
