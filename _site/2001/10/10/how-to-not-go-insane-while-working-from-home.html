<p class="intro">I've been working from home in Dublin, two days a week, for the last three weeks. It's been great, super, fantastic - but also challenging. I've noticed a few things have helped me in the last few weeks, and thought I'd share them (or at least put them out there as encouragement to me not to stray). I'd love to hear your own tips on working from home.</p>
<p>Let’s get straight to it:</p>

<h3 id="1-get-up">1. Get Up</h3>
<p>Okay, get up is simplistic - but I’ve <strong>started my days working at home at the same time</strong> as I would when working from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/designbyfront/1551995720/">Front Studio</a>. No ifs, ands or buts - I’m at my desk at 9am, or before, as I would be when working with the team in person.</p>

<h3 id="2-work-in-a-working-space">2. Work in a Working Space</h3>
<p>I’m lucky enough to <strong>have a separate room where I can work, just work</strong>. I don’t spend too much time in this space when I’m not working, so I’m physically and mentally away from work when I’m not in the home office. Work lives in there, not everywhere else - it’s okay to leave it there at the end of the day.</p>

<h3 id="3-leverage-the-interwebs-and-tubes">3. Leverage the Interwebs and Tubes</h3>
<p>Last year I was lucky enough to hear <a href="http://www.ideo.com/thinking/voice/gentry-underwood">Gentry Underwood</a> of IDEO talk about the <strong>company’s approach to collaboration and team working</strong>. The company uses always-on video conferencing, a rich Intranet (based on <a href="http://www.thoughtfarmer.com/">ThoughtFarmer</a>) and other tools to stay connected with eachother across time and geography.</p>

<p>We are clearly not IDEO, but I’ve tried to keep some of the advice from Gentry’s talk in mind. I do <strong>a scheduled call with Patsy</strong>, our Project Manager, every morning, and I’m <strong>available via landline phone, mobile phone and video chat/instant messanging</strong> throughout the day. I’d like to experiment with some <strong>always on</strong> video collaboration - maybe in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I’m also increasingly reliant on <strong>our own wiki</strong>, <a href="http://basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/docs">Google Docs</a> and the other collaboration tools we use.</p>

<h3 id="4-take-a-break-go-outside">4. Take a Break, Go Outside</h3>
<p>I take a quick break in the morning, a quick break in the afternoon, and a lunch in the middle of the day - pretty simple. <strong>I’m not allowed to take my lunch at my desk when working at home</strong>. I broke this rule last week, just the once, and by the end of the day I had been sitting at my desk for the vast majority of the day. Crankiness ensued. So, <strong>lunch is an outside of the office, preferably outside of the house break.</strong></p>

<h3 id="5-work-hard-on-one-or-two-things">5. Work Hard on One or Two Things</h3>
<p>Being stubborn enough to focus on doing a small number of things reasonably well is not really highly valued these days - <strong>I sometimes feel as though maintaining focus in the midst of the many tweets and pings and mails and calls is as big a challenge as the work itself</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m finding it increasingly important to <strong>focus quietly on one thing at a time, before I move on to something else when I feel I’ve made significant progress</strong>. I find this incredibly difficult, harder than it used to be, but it’s never been more obvious to me that this is how I work best. I wish I was able to multi-task really well; flitting between tasks and making progress on 5 fronts - but I’m not built for it; when I try to work like this I spend as much time transitioning between work as I do working.</p>

<h3 id="6-go-home">6. Go Home</h3>
<p><strong>At the end of the day, I walk home</strong>. I finish work at the same time as the guys in Belfast, log my time, leave the office and try to go outside for a while. I’ve noticed that when I don’t take an outdoor/out of the house break between finishing work, and being “at home” I think about work well into the evening because I haven’t had time to decompress - time I’d usually spend on the bus or walk home in Belfast. I’m trying to maintain the illusion of “going home”, even if it’s just a trip to the shops to buy milk.</p>

<h3 id="7-exercise">7. Exercise</h3>
<p>This is one I’ve been particularly bad at in the last few months; I’m not getting nearly enough exercise, which is making me restless and sluggish. **Not exercising has just highlighted how much I enjoy it and need it; time spent thinking of nothing, breathing, running, cycling, swimming. ** This maybe isn’t true with you, but for me doing light training through the week brings a bit of order and focus to the other parts of my life. So, very keen to get back to a training routine.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>These are just a few things that help me work effectively from home. I’m far from perfect - but I want to get better at working like this over time. I’d love to hear your own advice/thoughts on working from home.</p>
