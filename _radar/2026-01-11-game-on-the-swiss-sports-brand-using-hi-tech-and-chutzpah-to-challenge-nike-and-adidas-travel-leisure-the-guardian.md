I like stories like this. I can barely conceive of the complexity involved in starting up a fashion brand, let alone a footwear brand. Shoes are like chairs; they've undergone hundreds if not thousands of years of iterative design improvements. If you're thinking "I can do better", then you probably need to have some special insight into a specific usage context (like running) or the human body or materials or manufacturing processes - or a novel commercial model. You might need a bit of all of those. Not to mention, you face incredible cost and competitive pressures from massive brands and their supply chains. Good luck to these shoe nerds.
