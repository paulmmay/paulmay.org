Why can't I quit you, space exploration? 

<!-- After liftoff, the crew will loop twice around the Earth. Before heading to the moon, the Orion capsule will separate from the rocket’s upper stage. The astronauts will then fly the spacecraft manually, using cameras and the view outside the window, to approach and retreat from the jettisoned stage. This will give Nasa a sense of how Orion handles for future Artemis missions where crews will dock and undock in lunar orbit. -->
