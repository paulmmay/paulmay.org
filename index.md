Hello, my name is Paul May. I'm VP of Design at the software supply chain company [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com).

<h2>About Me</h2>

I've worked with [Frog Design](https://frogdesign.com) and [Monokoto](https://monokoto.com) for clients including Apple, Beats, Coloplast, Comcast, Denon, Ferrosan Medical Devices, Fritz Hansen, Marantz, Nordic Capical, GN Hearing, the UK Government, Virgin Atlantic. 

I spent a little while at the [Royal College of Art](https://www.rca.ac.uk) in London, helping students with interaction design and electronics projects. I learned as much from them as they did from me.

At [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org) I worked on their implementation of IBM Watson, and co-founded a cross-disciplinary data science + product development team, 

I studied at [DCU](https://www.dcu.ie) in Dublin, and attended NYU as a Fulbright Scholar.
