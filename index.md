## Paul May is a strategic designer and product innovator. He is VP of Design at the software company [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com).

Cloudsmith is a B2B SaaS company, serving the needs of platform engineering and information security teams. At Cloudsmith Paul's role spans all facets of design including discovery, product definition, feature definition, UX prototyping, product design, and brand design.

### Approach

Paul helps companies pull the future forward; identifying and acting upon opportunities that sit beyond near-term product roadmaps. He does this by helping companies: 

* Re-connect with customers' jobs to be done
* Understand relevant market forces and competitive benchmarks
* Explore new technologies via prototyping
* Separate true opportunities from mere ideas
* Establish and communicate an ambitious product vision
* Build and operate high-performing, cross-disciplinary product teams
* Implement a design-led approach to product development
* Ship useful, delightful, branded digital products

This collaborative, design-led approach lets companies break out of short-term thinking. It delivers more value to customers in shorter timeframes, and sets a new benchmark for quality in product categories.
