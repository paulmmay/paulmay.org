## Paul May is a strategic designer and product innovator. He is VP of Design at the software supply chain company [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com).

Cloudsmith is a B2B SaaS company, serving the needs of platform engineering and information security teams. At Cloudsmith Paul's role spans all facets of design; including new product and feature discovery, concept development, UX prototyping, product design, and brand design.

### Approach & Experience

Paul helps companies pull the future forward; identifying and acting upon opportunities that sit beyond near-term product roadmaps. He does this by helping companies: 

* Re-connect with customers' jobs to be done
* Understand relevant market forces and competitive benchmarks
* Explore new technologies via prototyping
* Separate true opportunities from mere ideas
* Establish and communicate an ambitious product vision
* Build cross-disciplinary product development teams
* Implement a design-led approach to product development
* Ship functional, delightful, branded digital products

This design-led approach lets companies break out of short-term thinking and cycles of incremental improvement. Working in this way delivers more value to customers in shorter timeframes, and sets a new benchmark for quality in product categories.

Paul has worked with [Frog Design](https://frogdesign.com) and [Monokoto](https://monokoto.com) for clients including Apple, Beats, Coloplast, Comcast, Denon, Ferrosan Medical Devices, Fritz Hansen, Marantz, Nordic Capital, GN Hearing, the UK Government, Virgin Atlantic.

At [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org) he worked on their early experiments with IBM Watson, then co-founded a cross-disciplinary machine learning & product development team. 

He studied at [DCU](https://www.dcu.ie) in Dublin, and attended [NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://itp.nyu.edu/) as a [Fulbright Scholar](https://fulbright.ie). He also worked at the [Royal College of Art](https://www.rca.ac.uk) in London, helping graduate students realise interaction design projects.
